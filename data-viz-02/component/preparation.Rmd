The scotus file comes originally from the Kaggle datasets webpages. I fixed a few small typos, but you can get pretty much the same results by downloading the original file and keeping the typos in there.

### Preparation, Draw a simple bar chart

Import the data and create a bar chart showing the frequency of opinions written by year_filed. Note that there are a few typos and a few rows that do not belong. You can remove these, but they will not affect any of the analyses we are considering.
