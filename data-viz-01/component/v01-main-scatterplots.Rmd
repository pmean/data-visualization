### Advanced exercise

+ There is a second data set on sleep in 
mammals. You can find a brief description of
this data set at
  + http://www.statsci.org/data/general/sleep.html
+ You can download the actual data at
  + http://www.statsci.org/data/general/sleep.txt

### Advanced exercise
+ Draw a visualization that illustrates the interrelationships among
  + bodywt, lifespan, gestation
  + bodywt, brainwt, and totalsleep
  + predation, exposure, and totalsleep
  + bodywt, predation, and lifespan
+ Divide the work among different group members

### Summary
+ "A mapping of data to the visual aesthetics of geometries/marks" 
  + Points are a type of geometry/mark
  + Aesthetics for points include location, shape, size, color
+ Basic tips
  + Don't try to squeeze in too much
  + Double up to emphasize
  + Shape is only good for categories
  + Shape and size don't mix
