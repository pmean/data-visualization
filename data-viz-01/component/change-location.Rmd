```

### Exercise, change the location

+ Use the Saratoga housing data set.
+ Revise the plot so that the location of the points represents x=Bedrooms and Y=Price.

<div class="notes">

Go back to the plot you just drew. Modify it so that the x location is Bedrooms and not Age.

</div>

### Exercise, Python code
+ Here's the Python code.
```
ch4 = alt.Chart(df).mark_point().encode(
      x='Bedrooms',y='Price')
```

### Exercise, Python output

![Python scatterplot of bedrooms and price](../images/python/altair-basic-exercise-location.png)

### Exercise, R code
+ Here's the R code
```
ggplot(saratoga_houses, aes(x=Bedrooms, y=Price)) + 
  geom_point())
```

### Here's the result in R

```{r bedrooms-and-price}
load("../../common-files/data/houses.RData")
initiate_image()
ggplot(saratoga_houses, aes(x=Bedrooms, y=Price)) + 
  geom_point()
finalize_image("Scatterplot of bedrooms and price")
```

`r display_image`

### Here are the results in Tableau.

<div class="notes">

In Tableau, click on Age in the Columns field and choose the remove option. The graph looks a bit weird with no columns, but ignore it. Drag Bedrooms over to the Columns field. Tableau wants to use a sum, but you want individual data points. So click on SUM(Bedrooms) and change it to a Dimension.

</div>
