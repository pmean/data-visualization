### Summary
+ "A mapping of data to the visual aesthetics of geometries/marks" 
  + Points are a type of geometry/mark
  + Aesthetics for points include location, shape, size, color
+ Basic tips
  + Don't try to squeeze in too much
  + Double up to emphasize
  + Shape is only good for categories
  + Shape and size don't mix
