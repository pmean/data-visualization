### Helpful tips

((Add three or four slides here. Maybe talk about opacity.))

### Group exercise

+ Review the following visualization in your group.
  + Summarize what aesthetics (location, size, shape, color) appear in the graph
  + What variables map to each aesthetic?

((Find new images or use the ones from earlier))
