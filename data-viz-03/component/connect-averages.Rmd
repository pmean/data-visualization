load("../../common-files/data/houses.RData")
```

### Exercise, Connect individual averages
+ Draw a scatterplot showing
  + X = Bathrooms
  + Y = Age
+ Add a line connect the individual averages

<div class="notes">

On your own, draw a scatterplot. Put the number of bathrooms on the X axis and the age of the house on the Y-axis. Add a line conencting the individual averages.

</div>

### Exercise, Python code

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
df = pd.read_csv("../../common-files/data/houses.csv")
```

```{python, echo=TRUE}
pts = alt.Chart(df).mark_point().encode(
    x='Bathrooms',
    y='Age'
)
avg =alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(
    x='Bathrooms',
    y='mean(Age)'
)
ch = pts+avg
```

```{python}
ch.save("../images/python/average-age.html")
```

<div class="notes">

Here is the Python code. Notice how you "add" the points graph and the average line graph.

</div>

### Exercise, Python output

<div class="notes">

Here is the Python output.

</div>

### Exercise, R code
+ Here's the R code
```
ggplot(saratoga_houses, aes(Bathrooms, Age)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")
```

<div class="notes">

The geom_point function creates the scatterplot and the stat_summary function adds the line.

</div>

### Exercise, R output
```{r exercise-average}
initiate_image()
ggplot(saratoga_houses, aes(Bathrooms, Age)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")
finalize_image()
```

`r display_image`

<div class="notes">

There is a clear and consistent trend in the average age. The average age declines as the number of bathrooms increase. There is a blip at the end, but this is probably just an artefact due to the small sample size.

</div>


### Exercise, Tableau steps
+ (Assuming you have a nice scatterplot already, and just need to add the line.)
+ Drag Age to the far right side of the graph
+ Change Age to Measure (Average)
+ Right click on the far right axis
  + Select Synchronize Axis
+ Click the pull down menu for Age
  + Convert back to Shape (Points)


<div class="notes">

The process in Tableau is a bit tricky. You need to drag age to the far right side of the graph to create a second axis. Then you need to change Age from Measure (Sum) to Measure (Average). Then you need to synchornize the left and right axes, by right clicking on the right axis.

Finally, change the line graph for Age back to points by selecting Shape from the pull-down menu.

</div>
