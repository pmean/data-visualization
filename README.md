# data-visualization

This repository contains R Markdown code to create five 
separate PowerPoint presentations on data visualization.

Here is how the files are organized.

data-viz-01/src. A folder containing R Markdown files, 
Powerpoint files, and PDF of speaker notes for the first 
two hours of
the workshop. 

data-viz-01/data. A folder containing data sets used in
the presentation and also in student exercises.

data-viz-01/images. A folder containing images used in 
the PowerPoint presentations along with copyright 
information on each image.

data-viz-02/src. A folder containing R Markdown files, 
Powerpoint files, and PDF of speaker notes for the 
second two hours of the workshop. 

Et cetera, et cetera

data-viz-05/images. A folder containing images used in
the PowerPoint presentations along with copyright
information on each image.

README.md. This file.

LICENSE. A text file that provides copyright information for
all of the presentation materials in this repository. Note 
that each image file has its own copyright information.

CITATION. A file asking for, but not demanding, a brief
acknowledgement if you use some or all of these files
in your own repository.

.gitignore, .RHistory, data-visualization.Rproj. Special files
to help R and git work properly. Unless you are a total geek,
you can safely ignore these files.
